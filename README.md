SL6-hiphop
==========

This is an attempt to make a vagrant-launchable VM with Facebook's excellent HipHop ready to go. Some dependencies are assumed to already be downloaded and are named in provision.sh

## Note

This battlestation is NOT fully operational - yet. You may run into issues when running the provisioning script, including make errors during gcc or hiphop itself.
